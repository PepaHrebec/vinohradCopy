[Original Website](https://www.vinohradskyparlament.cz/).

## Motivation

As with my other "copies" of various websites I found browsing the web, my motivation here was simply to practice. That and keeping my GitHub streak intact. Over the last few months I've been spending a lot of time on back-end, kinda neglecting basics of front-end. The website of **Vinohradsk√Ω Parlament** presented itself as a reasonable challenge, giving me a reason to try to implement features such as a sliding navbar, background filters and pretty extensive responsibility queries in general.

## Technologies used

- Pure HTML
- SCSS
- A bit of JS
- [Hamburger menu](https://jonsuh.com/hamburgers/) by Jonathan Suh *(I was curious about importing SCSS styles)*
